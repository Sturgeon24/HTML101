            <h2>What is Front-End Development?</h2>
            <p>Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website. It involves creating the parts of a website that users see and interact with, such as buttons, menus, and layouts. The front-end serves as the face of the application, combining design and functionality to deliver a seamless experience.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Used in Front-End Development</h2>
            <p>Front-end development relies on three core technologies: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it with colors and layouts, and JavaScript adds interactivity, such as animations or form validations. Together, they create dynamic and visually appealing websites.</p>
